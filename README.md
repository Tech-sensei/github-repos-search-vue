### Project Description 
GitHub-repos-search is a web application built using the Vue framework, designed to help users easily search for repositories on GitHub. With this application, users can easily search for repositories on GitHub by entering keywords related to the project, view information such as the repository's name, description, and stars, and even visit the repository's page on GitHub to learn more.

The Vue framework is an excellent choice for this project, as it allows for the creation of a fast, responsive, and user-friendly interface. Vue's reactive data binding makes it easy to update the user interface in real-time as the user types in their search query, while its component-based architecture allows for the creation of reusable UI components that can be used throughout the application.
